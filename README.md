# Sentiment Analysis 






## About the project :

● The model building and training is done on google colab with GPU as hardware.

● Amazon Mobile Electronics Review dataset is the dataset used for the training.

● Long Short Term Memory network (LSTM) used as a layer in the model building.
## Why Sentiment Analysis:
Sentiment Analysis is basically an analysis of text but a text with intent and meaning.Analysis
of text can be very useful in various fields.Many industries use it for reviews regarding
products , responses of the user for products etc. Many companies try to analyze their
products by analyzing the sentiment of their users review  in various social media handle eg.
Facebook twitter etc.This is a great way to improve and upgrade their products .


## LSTM

LSTM networks are widely used for sentimental analysis, speech recognition and language
modelling.
The Problem: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) experience the ill effects of transient memory.
They face difficulty conveying data further on in the event that a succession is adequately long.
During back propagation, RNN experiences the ill effects of the disappearing gradient issue,
generally in the previous layers. RNN's can fail to remember what is found in longer
arrangements, consequently having a transient memory, in light of the fact that these layers don't
learn.

The Solution: LSTM works on the concept of gates, like a forget gate to overcome drawbacks of
RNN.
